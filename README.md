# FiGE Website Design (Archived)
## *DISCLAMIER*

The Foundations in Global Engagement (FiGE) program is currently under hibernation. All information included here is as of April 2019 and could be out-dated. For further information about FiGE program, please go to [Global Penn State's website](https://global.psu.edu/fige).

## Introduction

*Foundations in Global Engagement* (FiGE) program is designed to facilitate intercultural communication and appreciation and help first-year students to transit to new life at Penn State. A separate webpage (www.fige.psu.edu) was built-up and designed in October 2017 by [Eric Zhewen Li](https://www.zhewenli.com), who served as one of program's student coordinators at the time. This separation from FiGE's subdomain under Global Penn State is intended to provide more detailed and up-to-date information about the program, as well as to include some interactive elements to promote program awareness among student body. This project is a part of FiGE's transition to a student-run-organization that better serves its targeted students.
